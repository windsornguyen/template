## Introduction

Flash STU is a highly optimized, open-source PyTorch implementation of the Spectral Transform Unit (STU) as proposed in [*Spectral State Space Models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06837) by Agarwal et al. (2024).

The [STU](stu.py) module is a fast and flexible building block that can be adapted into a wide range of neural network architectures, especially those that aim to solve tasks with long-range dependencies.

## Features

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Fast convolutions using [Flash FFT](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-fft-conv)
- üöÄ Fast, local attention using (sliding window) [Flash Attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention)
- üåê Support for distributed training using [DDP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html) and [FSDP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html)

## Installation

> **Note**: CUDA is required to run code from this repository.

This repository was tested with:
- Python 3.12.5
- PyTorch 2.4.0
- Triton 3.0.0
- CUDA 12.4

and may be incompatible with other versions.

1. Install PyTorch with CUDA support:
    ```bash
    pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
    ```

2. Install Flash Attention:
   ```bash
   pip install ninja
   MAX_JOBS=4 pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
   ```

3. Install Flash FFT:
   ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-fft-conv.git#subdirectory=csrc/flashfftconv
    pip install git+https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-fft-conv.git
    ```

4. Install the rest of the requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

An example training script for pretraining a large language model is provided in [`example.py`](example.py).

If your compute cluster does not have internet access, you will need to pre-download the entire dataset before running the example script.

To download the dataset, run:
```bash
python data.py
```

To begin training, use `torchrun` and specify the number of GPUs you want to use. Recall that `nnodes` refers to the number of nodes and `nproc_per_node` refers to the number of processes (GPUs) on each node. For example:

```bash
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=1 --max-restarts=3 example.py
```

> **Note**: The FineWeb-Edu 10B-token sample is a relatively large dataset. It can be swapped out for something smaller, e.g. [TinyStories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories) (476.6M tokens).


## Configuration

Training configurations can be adjusted as needed in [`config.json`](config.json).

> **Note**: PyTorch's `torch.compile` currently does not have great support for distributed wrapper modules like DDP or FSDP. If you encounter errors during training, try disabling `torch.compile`. For more information on `torch.compile`, see this [informal manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y5CRfMLdwEoF1nTk9q8qEu1mgMUuUtvhklPKJ2emLU8/edit#heading=h.ivdr7fmrbeab).
